Usage

![How Farmbot will work](diagram.png)

You will need to CURL for now. Eventually, there will be a Farmbot graphical frontend. API docs are on the way!

Pre-install Dependencies
===
1. [Install MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)
2. [Install Ruby 2.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
2. [Install Rails4](http://rubyonrails.org/download)

We don't have a one step build yet. Sorry :(

Installation
===
 1. Clone this repo
 2. In terminal, `cd` into this projects root directory
 3. Install MongoDB and run it via `mongod`
 4. Set a secret token environment variable for the application (`export SECRET_TOKEN=STRONG_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_HASH`)
 5. `bundle install`
